# YosysHQ - Open Source EDA

### OSS CAD Suite: the one-stop shop for our tools

If you want to use our EDA tools, the easiest way is to install the binary release [OSS CAD suite](https://github.com/YosysHQ/oss-cad-suite-build/releases/latest), which contains all required dependencies and related tools. Find the [documentation here](https://yosyshq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
We also have an [OSS CAD Suite github action](https://github.com/YosysHQ/setup-oss-cad-suite) for using the tools in a github CI workflow.

[Tabby CAD Suite](https://www.yosyshq.com/tabby-cad-datasheet) is a commercial extension of OSS CAD Suite available from [YosysHQ GmbH](https://www.yosyshq.com/about) that additionally includes the Verific frontend for industry-grade SystemVerilog and VHDL support, formal verification with SVA, and formal apps.
